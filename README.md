README for Flask-Based Database Query Application
This application is a Flask-based web service that allows users to connect to various databases, execute queries, and retrieve results. It also supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating SQL queries based on natural language questions.

Features
Database Connection: Connect to MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases.
Query Execution: Execute SQL queries and retrieve results.
Database Schema Retrieval: Fetch and display the schema of the connected database.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Use a vector store to generate SQL queries from natural language questions.
Fine-Tuning: Placeholder function for fine-tuning the language model (LLM) using custom training data.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Flask: Web framework for building the application.
LangChain: Library for working with language models and retrieval-augmented generation.
FAISS: Library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
OpenAI Embeddings: For generating embeddings for the vector store.
Database Drivers:
mysql-connector-python for MySQL.
psycopg2 for PostgreSQL.
sqlite3 for SQLite (included in Python standard library).

Installation
Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository-url>

Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set Up Environment Variables:
Ensure that the necessary environment variables (e.g., OpenAI API key) are set up.
Usage

Run the Application:

Access the Web Interface:

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Connect to a Database:

Use the /connect endpoint to connect to a database. Provide the following details:
db_type: Type of database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
username: Database username.
password: Database password.
host: Database host.
port: Database port.
database: Database name.
Execute Queries:

Use the /query endpoint to execute SQL queries. Provide a natural language question, and the application will generate and execute the corresponding SQL query.
Initialize RAG:

Use the /initialize_rag endpoint to initialize the vector store for RAG. Provide the path to the data directory containing the documents.
Fine-Tune the LLM:

Use the /fine_tune endpoint to fine-tune the language model. Provide the training data in the request body.
